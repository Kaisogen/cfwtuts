<h3><p style="width:39%;">guide one - setting up input redirection (june 6, 2017)</p></h3>
<p style="width:39%;">first off, you need to download <a href="https://github.com/pillows2/cfwtuts/raw/master/downloads/input_redir/input_redir.zip">this</a> (downloads instantly) and open it. then you can go into FBI on your 3ds, then click "remote install." from there, click "receive URLs over the network" then write the IP adress in the box in the program you downloaded.


<p style="width:39%;">now, you can go to the home menu and enter this button combo: <b>L, DOWN, SELECT</b> in no particular order. note that this is default and can be changed.<sup>1</sup> now, you can use the d-pad to select "miscellaneous options..." then select "start inputredirection." you can now use input redirection if you connect an x-input controller (for example xbox 360/one controllers) into your computer, you can use them with your 3ds. note that the controller does not work with the rosalina menu.


<h3> </h3><sup>1: guide to change button combo will be written later</sup>
